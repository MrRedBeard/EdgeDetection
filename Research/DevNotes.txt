Using Cartesian coordinate system
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system





2 Points meet Joining Lines

x1, y1
x2, y2

x1 == x2 & (y1 == y2 || y1 == (y2-1) || y1 == (y2+1)
y1 == y2 & x1 == x2 || x1 == (x2-1) || x1 == (x2+1)





Flipping xy on y

Distance between 2 points
d = \sqrt{(x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2}


Translation moving # points up/down or x/y by setting a/b
foreach
x=x+a
y=y+b

Rotation
counterclockwise around origin by some angle \theta 
x = x cos theta - y sin theta
y = x sin theta + y cos theta

Scaling s is same value for each
x = s*x
y = s*y
